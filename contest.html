  History
See also: Timeline of Sanaa
Ancient period
According to popular legend, Sanaa was founded at the base of the mountains of Jabal Nuqum[4] by Shem, the son of Noah,[9][10][11] after the latter's death. It was known as "Azal" in ancient times, which has been connected to Uzal, a son of Qahtan, a great-grandson of Shem, in the biblical accounts of the Book of Genesis.[12] Its name is related to the Sabaic word for "well-fortified".[13][14]

The Arab historian al-Hamdani wrote that Sanaa was walled by the Sabaeans under their ruler Sha'r Awtar, who also arguably built the Ghumdan Palace in the city. Because of its location, Sanaa has served as an urban hub for the surrounding tribes of the region and as a nucleus of regional trade in southern Arabia. It was positioned at the crossroad of two major ancient trade routes linking Ma'rib in the east to the Red Sea in the west.[11]

When King Yousef Athar (or Dhu Nuwas), the last of the Himyarite kings, was in power, Sana Ωa was also the capital of the Axumite viceroys.
